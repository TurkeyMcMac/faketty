.SH NAME

\fBfaketty\fR - Simulate standard streams being terminals or not


.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBfaketty\fR [\fB-iIoOeEhv\fR] [--] \fICOMMAND ARGS\fR...


.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBfaketty\fR runs the given \fICOMMAND\fR with the given \fIARGS\fR. When the
command calls \fBisatty\fR(3), the function is intercepted using LD_PRELOAD. The
function may return true or false independent of whether stdin/stdout/stderr is
actually a terminal.


.SH OPTIONS

.IP \fB-i\fR
Pretend standard input is a terminal.

.IP \fB-I\fR
Pretend standard input is not a terminal.

.IP \fB-o\fR
Pretend standard output is a terminal.

.IP \fB-O\fR
Pretend standard output is not a terminal.

.IP \fB-e\fR
Pretend standard error is a terminal.

.IP \fB-E\fR
Pretend standard error is not a terminal.

.IP \fB-h\fR
Print help information and exit.

.IP \fB-v\fR
Print version information and exit.


.SH EXIT STATUS

\fBfaketty\fR exits with 0 on success. When it fails, it returns 1. If the
command is run, then the exit status is the exit status of the command.


.SH ENVIRONMENT

.IP LD_PRELOAD
This variable is overriden to intercept calls to \fBisatty\fR(3).


.SH BUGS

The entire implementation is pretty hacky and might not work in some places
where it seems like it should. Only \fBisatty\fR(3) is intercepted, not other
methods of determining the same thing. Many programs use the call to determine
whether to use color and so on, but most have ways of forcing such things on or
off. When possible, use those built-in mechanisms.
